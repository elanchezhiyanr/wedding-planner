# Why Knots & Vows is created

The moment you decide to get married, a wave of excitement washes over you. Visions of the perfect day, the laughter, the love, the celebration – it’s all incredibly thrilling. We’ve been there. When we decided to tie the knot, we dreamt of an intimate beach wedding, something unique and truly "us," even though it was a rare concept for our budget and location here in India. We had six months, and initially, we thought, "This is going to be an amazing journey, creating memories every step of the way!"

Little did we know that our beautiful dream would soon morph into a rather challenging reality.a

The initial joy of planning gradually got buried under an avalanche of tasks and decisions. What we imagined as a beautiful collaborative experience started feeling like a second full-time job, and honestly, a tedious one at that.

### The Quest for the “Perfect” (and the Practical)

Our dream of a beach wedding, for instance, wasn't straightforward. Finding a location that was both beautiful and fit our budget felt like searching for a hidden treasure. We spent countless hours, days, and weekends scouting multiple spots, negotiating, and trying to align our vision with practical constraints. It was exhausting.

Then came the vendors. Oh, the vendors! From trying to find affordable yet elegant jewellery rentals (because who buys everything for just one day, right?) to coordinating decorators, caterers, and florists for garlands and everything else – each was a separate thread to manage. We found ourselves drowning in a sea of options, quotes, and follow-ups.

### The Balancing Act: Dreams vs. Spreadsheets

One of the biggest shocks was how quickly expenses could spiral if not meticulously tracked. We’d find the perfect something, get excited, and then scramble to see how it fit into the ever-evolving budget. There was this constant, nagging worry: "Are we missing something? How much have we actually spent on this category? Are we over budget already?" Trying to keep a clear financial picture while juggling everything else was a monumental task. We needed a way to see where every rupee was going, but all the tracking felt disconnected from the actual planning tasks.

### The Overwhelm of a Thousand Moving Parts

Beyond the big items, there were the seemingly endless smaller tasks. Sending out invitations (and tracking RSVPs!), booking accommodation for guests, coordinating transport, planning the sequence of ceremonies, and yes, even trying to plan our honeymoon in parallel! Each task, while exciting in isolation, contributed to a growing mountain of things to do.

What we desperately needed was a central hub, a command centre that could connect all these disparate elements. We yearned for a smart task manager that didn't just list tasks but understood the interconnected nature of wedding planning, offering timely reminders so nothing slipped through the cracks. We searched for solutions, hoping to find a digital lifeline. But most tools felt either too generic, too complicated, or simply didn't address the holistic, often chaotic, reality of planning an Indian wedding. Instead of easing the burden, the search for the right tool often became yet another chore.

### From Our Struggle to Your Solution

It was amidst this whirlwind, feeling the pressure and the dimming of that initial joyful spark, that the idea for this planner was born. We realized that if we, a couple deeply invested in creating a unique and personal wedding, were facing such hurdles, countless others must be too.

We believe that planning your wedding – whether it’s an intimate gathering of your closest loved ones or a grand, multi-day festival with thousands of guests – should be as beautiful and memorable an experience as the wedding day itself. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice your peace of mind or the joy of your engagement period to navigate a labyrinth of complexities.

That’s why we set out to build a solution that we wish we’d had. A planner that’s more than just a checklist. An intuitive, empathetic, and humanized platform designed to understand the real-world challenges of wedding planning. A system that embraces the uniqueness of your vision, helps you manage the nitty-gritty without the headache, keeps you on track and on budget, and ultimately, lets you focus on what truly matters: celebrating your love and embarking on your new life together.

We’re building this because we’ve lived the stress, and we passionately believe there’s a better way. A way where technology supports your dreams, simplifies the complexities, and helps you reclaim the joy of wedding planning.

We’re just at the beginning of our journey, and we’re so excited to share it with you.
